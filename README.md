1. How does your crawler work? What information does it extract from the page? How does
it store the data? Is there any intermediary processing you perform to facilitate the later
steps of the assignment?
2. Discuss the RESTful design of your server. How has your implementation incorporated
the various REST principles?
3. Explain how the content score for the search is generated.
4. Discuss the PageRank calculation and how you have implemented it.
5. How have you defined your page selection policy for your crawler for your personal site?
6. Why did you select the personal site you chose? Did you run into any problems when
working with this site? How did you address these problems?
7. Critique your search engine. How well does it work? How well will it scale? How do you
think it could be improved?
